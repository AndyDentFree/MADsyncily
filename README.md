# MADsyncily
MongoDB Atlas Device SDK explorations (formerly the Realm mobile database)

## SyncOddly
The first demo app is SyncOddly, which shows an architecture for sharing appointments and notes with other users.

It also lets you choose between using FlexibleSync with a MongoDB Atlas server, or just a local database.
