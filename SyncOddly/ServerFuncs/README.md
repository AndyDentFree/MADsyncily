# SyncOddly - ServerFuncs

This directory contains copies of the serverside JS functions.

- `reset_pwd.js` the original they provided as template in comment, with invalid function (because always fails)
- `resetPwdUnvalidatedDangerous.js` simple _always succeed_ function, dangerous because doesn't validate user is requesting password change
